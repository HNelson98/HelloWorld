# Overview

This is a basic python program that will diplay "Hello World" in the console

I created this software to ensure that my IDE was set up properly and that 
python is installed correctly. I also created this project to set up a basic
template for my software portfolio.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write the code for this project. I used the most 
recent version of python version 3.11.3 to write and run the code. Python is
a very simple language, and I was able to write the code in a few seconds.
